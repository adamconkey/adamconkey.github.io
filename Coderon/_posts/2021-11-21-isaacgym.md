The last project I worked on during my Ph.D., [Planning under Uncertainty to Goal Distributions]({% post_url 2022-04-29-goal-distributions %}), involved learning robot skills from demonstration data. The other projects I had worked on involved learning from human demonstration data, but that was not an option for this project -- we needed a huge amount of data. We were trying to learn probabilistic skill effect models that would enable the robot to predict how manipulation actions would affect an object's state while accounting for the uncertainties in the object dynamics in the environment. Instead of having a human provide thousands and thousands of demonstrations, we wanted a way we could record data of the robot performing the tasks in an unsupervised way.

Our solution was to engineer some behaviors using simple task specifications, and motion-planned trajectories to execute them. This could have been done on the real robot, but that was also a bottleneck because in order to learn the skill models, we needed a lot... A LOT, of data. The solution was to record the data in simulation. But even one simulator collecting data was going to take a long time to run. The even better solution, was to run many simulations at once! And fortunately, I was working on this at the advent of NVIDIA's [Isaac Gym](https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac-gym), which enabled running hundreds of simulations at once on a desktop computer (note Isaac Gym has since been deprecated, in favor of NVIDIA's Omniverse stack).

I developed a framework for mass data collection of robot skill executions in Isaac Gym. This was a huge undertaking which I spent much of the COVID pandemic lockdown toiling away on. It required thoughtful system engineering to develop not just the infrastructure to define and execute robot skills, but to configure simulation environments, record multimodal data, and run autonomously for days at a time. I'll go into details on some of the more interesting components.
