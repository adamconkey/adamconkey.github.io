The last project I worked on during my Ph.D., [Planning under Uncertainty to Goal Distributions]({% post_url 2022-04-29-goal-distributions %}), involved learning robot skills from demonstration data. The other projects I had worked on involved learning from human demonstration data, but that was not an option for this project -- we needed a HUGE amount of data. Instead of having a human provide thousands and thousands of demonstrations, we wanted a way we could record data of the robot performing the tasks in an unsupervised way.

Our solution was to engineer some behaviors using simple task specifications  and motion-planned trajectories to execute them. This could have been done on the real robot, but that was also going to involve a fair amount of babysitting by a human. The solution was to record the data in simulation. But collecting data from just one simulator was going to take a really long time. The even better solution was to run many simulations at once! And fortunately, I was working on this at the advent of NVIDIA's [Isaac Gym](https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac-gym), which enabled running hundreds of simulations at once on a desktop computer (note Isaac Gym has since been deprecated, in favor of NVIDIA's Omniverse stack).

I developed a framework for mass data collection of robot skill executions in Isaac Gym. This was a huge undertaking which I spent much of the COVID pandemic lockdown toiling away on. It required thoughtful system engineering to develop the infrastructure for skill definition and execution, configuration of the simulation environments, recording and managing multimodal datasets, and running it all autonomously for days at a time. I'll go into details on some of the more interesting components.
