I was honored, and frankly surprised, to be accepted as a member of the [2020 RSS Pioneers](https://sites.google.com/view/rsspioneers2020) cohort. This is an annual workshop held during the Robotics Science and Systems (RSS) conference intended to bring together promising robotics researchers early in their career. I applied feeling confident I would not even be up for consideration, and imagine my surprise when I was informed I was accepted! Perhaps I am just imposter syndrome incarnate, but in any event, it was truly an honor to be involved and I am grateful for the opportunity.

We were in the height of the COVID pandemic during the workshop, so it was all remote over Zoom. I was not too pleased about that as I enjoy traveling and attending conferences, and the Zoom experience was sometimes too awkward for me to put up with -- there was a mass Zoom social hour at the end, too much for this introvert to be party to. But it was great seeing everyone's presentations, and I especially enjoyed the keynote speakers providing their perspective on a career in robotics.

I will leave [this link](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1nLjvhEIVO1X21Gvn9QoXYgMp4Zn5SUaU) to my submitted paper where you can read the highlights of the research agenda I had proposed, one I still feel strongly about as a path forward to some truly impressive robots. You can view the presentation I recorded for the workshop in the YouTube video at the top of this page.
